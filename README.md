# FPGA_ML_DATASET
This is the datasets used for fpga performance evaluation via machine learning. It contains thousands of verilog designs which can be used to train machine learning model and perform performance prediction.
It contains two categories according to the source of programs: HLS_dataset and Verilog_dataset.

## HLS_dataset
It contains verilog designs generated from C program via high level synthesis. We refered to [PowerGear](https://github.com/zlinaf/PowerGear) and extended their methods to apply to varities of C benchmark to increase the diversities of verilog designs. This repo summarize how the generated verilog design look like while it does not contain the actual generated verilog designs, for the actualy verilog designs downloading, please refer to the below links.

polybench: [xc7v585tffg1157-3.tar.gz](https://lca.ece.utexas.edu/hls_dataset/xc7v585tffg1157-3.tar.gz) and [xczu9eg-ffvb1156-2-i.tar.gz](  https://lca.ece.utexas.edu/hls_dataset/xczu9eg-ffvb1156-2-i.tar.gz)  
chstone:   work in progress  
machsuite: work in progress  

Noted that in each tar ball, it contains:
1. verilog files and tcl scripts which can be used directly in vivado
2. IR codes(.bc), IR operator information(.adb), FSMD mdoel(.adb.xml), HLS report(.rpt, .rpt.xml) generated from vivado HLS

## Verilog_dataset
It contains verilog designs collected from different domains. It contains only raw designs for now.

# TODO
1. csv files alignment
2. tar ball update: remove report files
3. one more high hierechy
4. update the csv with the features in ppt.
